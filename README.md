## 🌍 Powered by OpenWeatherAPI and RapidAPI  

This weather app pulls its data from two powerful APIs:

1. **[OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/)**:  
   Provides real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, for cities worldwide.  

2. **[Cities API from RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)**:  
   Helps us fetch city details (like city name, population, and geographical data) to enhance the user experience when searching for locations.
